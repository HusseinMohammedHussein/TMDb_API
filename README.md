# TMDb_API
Welcome in Android Project App to display Movies of TMDb_API (The Movies Database) website.
First my Android App by Retrofit, REST API.
Used in it GSON, GLIDE, RETROFIT, RecyclerView, CardView,
REST API, Design Library.

**TO USE APP** you need to turn-on mobile internet to display Movies.
**TO SHOW DETAILS** of a Movie on click on a movie will open mobile webview and to display everything about a movie.

IF you have some idea to add to the app, I will be happy :)
